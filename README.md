# MetaSBT

A scalable framework for automatically indexing microbial genomes and accurately characterizing metagenome-assembled genomes with Sequence Bloom Trees

Please visit the official [wiki](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT/wiki) to get started playing with MetaSBT.

Also note that we maintain a series of public databases built with our framework over a set of curated microbial genomes. They are all indexed in our [MetaSBT-DBs](https://github.com/cumbof/MetaSBT-DBs) repository.

> **Note**
> Are you interested in using our software and databases, or you want to build your own private database, but you do not have enough computational resources? Get in touch with us, we are always happy to collaborate!
